# gratitude

a simple app to log your gratitude

## Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [Presently](https://github.com/alisonthemonster/Presently), and I started it for two reasons:

- Lack of support of Presently for the newer android versions
- Will to learn more about android development

Note: This is not a fork, and is being developed from the ground up in flutter.
